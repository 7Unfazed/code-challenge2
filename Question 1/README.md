## Introduction 
  I'm required to write a program that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. 
## Expectations
example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.
## How to Use
1. Make sure you have node.js installed in your system
2. Navigate to the index.js file
3. Run the program by typing node index.js on the terminal
4. Follow the prompt to input the string.
## Implementation Details
The system uses prompt sync to prompt the user to input the details
If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase and returns it.
If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase and returns it.
