 ## Introduction 
  I'm required to write a program that  takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. ensure that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array.
## Expectations
example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
## How to Use
1. Make sure you have node.js installed in your system
2. Navigate to the index.js file
3. Run the program by typing node index.js on the terminal
4. Follow the prompt to input the numbers without using commas.
## Implementation Details
The system uses prompt sync to prompt the user to input the details
If num1 is less than or equal to num2, it iterates from num1 to num2 and pushes each number into the array.
If num1 is greater than num2, it iterates from num1 to num2 in descending order and pushes each number into the array.
Finally, it returns the array containing the range of numbers.
